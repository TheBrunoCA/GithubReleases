Notes\r\n\r\n* When installing on MacOS from the `.dmg` file (since Lite XL is not signed anymore) you will need to clear the App attributes in order to be able to launch it. To do so open the terminal and run `xattr -cr /Applications/Lite\\ XL.app`, afterwards you should be able to launch Lite XL normally.\r\n\r\n### Addons vs non-addons packages\r\n\r\nThe addon packages besides including the Lite XL binary also include additional plugins to make the initial experience more accesible. The extra features the addon packages include are:\r\n\r\n* All language plugins.\r\n* All color scheme plugins.\r\n* Widgets + settings gui plugin for easier configuration.\r\n* Open externally plugin, which detects if a file been open is valid utf-8 and offers to open it externally if not.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* Add config.keep_newline_whitespace option ([#1184](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1184))\r\n\r\n* Add regex.find_offsets, regex.find, improve regex.match ([#1232](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1232))\r\n\r\n* Added regex.gmatch ([#1233](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1233))\r\n\r\n* add touch events ([#1245](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1245))\r\n\r\n### Performance Improvements\r\n\r\n*

([#1233](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1233))\r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n* For correctness, the behaviour of `regex.match` was changed to more closely behave like `string.match`.\r\n\r\n* `regex.find_offsets` now provides the previous functionality of `regex.match` with a more appropriate function name.\r\n\r\n* `regex.gsub` doesn't provides the indexes of matches and replacements anymore, now it behaves more similar to `string.gsub` (the only known affected plugin was `regexreplacepreview` which has already been adapted)\r\n\r\n### UI

Notes\r\n\r\n* When installing on MacOS from the `.dmg` file (since Lite XL is not signed anymore) you will need to clear the App attributes in order to be able to launch it.

([#1110](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1110))\r\n\r\n* Added in native modules suffixes. ([#1111](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1111))\r\n\r\n* plugin scale: added option to set default scale ([#1115](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1115))\r\n\r\n* Added in ability to have init.so as a require for cpath. ([#1126](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1126))\r\n\r\n* Added system.raise_window() ([#1131](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1131))\r\n\r\n* Initial horizontal scrollbar support ([#1124](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1124))\r\n\r\n* IME support ([#991](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/991))\r\n\r\n### Performance Improvements\r\n\r\n* [Load space metrics only when creating font](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1032)\r\n\r\n* [Performance improvement](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/883) of detect indent plugin.\r\n\r\n* Improve performance of [ren_draw_rect](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/935).\r\n\r\n* Improved [tokenizer performance](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/896).\r\n\r\n* drawwhitespace: [Cache whitespace location](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1030)\r\n\r\n* CommandView: improve performance by [only drawing visible](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1047)\r\n\r\n### Backward Incompatible Changes\r\n* [Upgraded Lua to 5.4](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/781), which should improve performance, and provide useful extra functionality. It should also be more available out of the box with most modern linux/unix-based package managers.\r\n\r\n* Bumped plugin mod-version number as various interfaces like: `DocView`, `StatusView` and `CommandView` have changed which should require a revision from plugin developers to make sure their plugins work with this new release.\r\n\r\n* Changed interface for key handling; now, all components should return true if they've handled the event.\r\n\r\n* For plugin developers, declaring config options by directly assigning to the plugin table (eg: `config.plugins.plugin_name.myvalue = 10`) was deprecated in favor of using `common.merge`.\r\n\r\n  **Example:**\r\n  ```lua\r\n  config.plugins.autowrap = common.merge({\r\n    enabled = false,\r\n    files = { \"%.md$\", \"%.txt$\" }\r\n  }, config.plugins.autowrap)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `DocView:draw_text_line` and related functions been used by plugin developers require a revision, since some of this interfaces were updated to support line wrapping.\r\n\r\n* Removed `cp_replace`, and replaced this with a core plugin, [drawwhitespace.lua](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/908).\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Features\r\n* For plugins the usage of the `--lite-xl` version tag was dropped in favor of `--mod-version`.\r\n\r\n* Overriding `StatusView:get_items()` has been deprecated in favor of the new dedicated interface to insert status bar items:\r\n\r\n  **New Interface:**\r\n  ```lua\r\n  ------@return StatusView.Item\r\n  function StatusView:add_item(\r\n    { predicate, name, alignment, get_item, command, position, tooltip, separator }\r\n  ) end\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  **Example:**\r\n  ```lua\r\n  core.status_view:add_item({\r\n    predicate = nil,\r\n    name = \"status:memory-usage\",\r\n    alignment = StatusView.Item.RIGHT,\r\n    get_item = function()\r\n      return {\r\n        style.text,\r\n        string.format(\r\n          \"%.2f MB\",\r\n          (math.floor(collectgarbage(\"count\") / 10.24) / 100)\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    end,\r\n    command = nil,\r\n    position = 1,\r\n    tooltip = \"lua memory usage\",\r\n    separator = core.status_view.separator2\r\n  })\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* [CommandView:enter](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1004) now accepts a single options table as a parameter, meaning that the old way of calling this function will now show a deprecation message. Also `CommandView:set_text` and `CommandView:set_hidden_suggestions` has been [deprecated](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1014).\r\n\r\n  **Example:**\r\n  ```lua\r\n  core.command_view:enter(\"Title\", {\r\n    submit = function() end,\r\n    suggest = function() return end,\r\n    cancel = function() end,\r\n    validate = function() return true end,\r\n    text = \"\",\r\n    select_text = false,\r\n    show_suggestions = true,\r\n    typeahead = true,\r\n    wrap = true\r\n  })\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n* Removed `dmon`, and implemented independent backends for dirmonitoring. Also more cleanly split out dirmonitoring into its own class in lua, from core.init. We should now support FreeBSD; and any other system that uses `kqueue` as their dir monitoring library. We also have a dummy-backend, which reverts transparently to scanning if there is some issue with applying OS-level watches (such as system limits).\r\n\r\n* Removed `libagg` and the font renderer; compacted all font rendering into a single renderer.c file which uses `libfreetype` directly. Now allows for ad-hoc bolding, italics, and underlining of fonts.\r\n\r\n* Removed `reproc` and replaced this with a simple POSIX/Windows implementation in `process.c`. This allows for greater tweakability (i.e. we can now `break` for debugging purposes), performance (startup time of subprocesses is noticeably shorter), and simplicity (we no longer have to link reproc, or winsock, on windows).\r\n\r\n* [Split out `Node` and `EmptyView`](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/715) into their own lua files, for plugin extensibility reasons.\r\n\r\n* Improved fuzzy_matching to probably give you something closer to what you're looking for.\r\n\r\n* Improved handling of alternate keyboard layouts.\r\n\r\n* Added in a default keymap for `core:restart`, `ctrl+shift+r`.\r\n\r\n* Improvements to the [C and C++](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/875) syntax files.\r\n\r\n* Improvements to [markdown](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/862) syntax file.\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to borderless](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/994) mode on Windows.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bunch of problems relating to [multi-cursor](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/886).\r\n\r\n* NagView: [support vscroll](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/876) when message is too long.\r\n\r\n* Meson improvements which include:\r\n  * Added in meson wraps for freetype, pcre2, and SDL2 which target public, rather than lite-xl maintained repos.\r\n  * [Seperate dirmonitor logic](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/866), add build time detection of features.\r\n  * Add [fallbacks](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/798) to all common dependencies.\r\n  * [Update SDL to 2.0.20](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/884).\r\n  * install [docs/api](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/979) to datadir for lsp support.\r\n\r\n* Always check if the beginning of the [text needs to be clipped](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/871).\r\n\r\n* Added [git commit](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/859) on development builds.\r\n\r\n* Update [autocomplete](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/832) with changes needed for latest LSP plugin.\r\n\r\n* Use SDL to manage color format mapping in [ren_draw_rect](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/829).\r\n\r\n* Various code [clean ups](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/826).\r\n\r\n* [Autoreload Nagview](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/942).\r\n\r\n* [Enhancements to scrollbar](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/916).\r\n\r\n* Set the correct working directory for the [AppImage version](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/937).\r\n\r\n* Core: fixes and changes to [temp file](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/906) functions.\r\n\r\n* [Added plugin load-time log](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/966).\r\n\r\n* TreeView improvements for [multi-project](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1010).\r\n\r\n* Open LogView on user/project [module reload error](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1022).\r\n\r\n* Check if [\"open\" pattern is escaped](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1034)\r\n\r\n* Support [UTF-8 on Windows](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1041) (Lua)\r\n\r\n* Make system.* functions support [UTF8 filenames on windows](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1042)\r\n\r\n* [Fix memory leak](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1039) and wrong check in font_retrieve\r\n\r\n* CommandView: do not change caret size with config.line_height ([#1080](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1080))\r\n\r\n* Fixed process layer argument quoting; allows for strings with spaces ([#1132](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1132))\r\n\r\n* Draw lite-xl icon in TitleView ([#1143](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1143))\r\n\r\n* Add parameter validation to checkcolor and f_font_group ([#1145](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/1145))\r\n\r\n* Many, many, many more changes that are too numerous to list.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Not-a-web-Developer made their first

new release fixes some outstanding problem with the directory monitoring and add some minor improvements.\r\n\r\n## Improved project's module\r\n\r\nNow any modification to the project's module is immediately applied when the file is saved.\r\nThis is very useful to configure a `config.ignore_files`and have an immediate feedback.\r\n\r\nAs an additional improvement, now when reloading the project's module, we check again if the project fits within the maximum number of files and the application acts accordingly.\r\nThis means that if a project exceeds the max project files limit and we act by ignoring some large directories we immediately get back the usual behavior with all the project files indexed and easily reachable.\r\n\r\nTo be also more beginner friendly now, when creating a new project's module, we propose a template with some useful instructions.\r\n\r\n## Ignore files on path\r\n\r\nUntil now the ìgnore_files`mechanism was limited to the name of the file or directory and it was not possible to look at its path within the project folder.\r\nWe solved the problem by implementing two new mechanisms inspired by gitignore.\r\n\r\nEssentially there are two new rules:\r\n\r\n- if a '/' or a '/$' appear at the end of the pattern it will match only directories\r\n- if a '/' appears anywhere in the pattern except at the end the pattern will be\r\n  applied to the path\r\n\r\nIn the first case, when the pattern corresponds to a directory, a '/' will be\r\nappended to the name of the directory before checking the pattern.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, when the pattern corresponds to a path, the complete path of\r\nthe file or directory will be used with an initial '/' for the project's root.\r\n\r\nThe new mechanisms are backward compatible so existing project's module should work as before.\r\n\r\n## Directory Monitoring Fixes\r\n\r\nFix several problems with the directory monitoring library.\r\nNow the application should no longer assert when some related system call fails and we fallback to rescan when an error happens.\r\nOn linux we no longer use the recursive monitoring which was a source of problem.\r\n\r\nDirectory monitoring is now aware of symlinks and treat them appropriately.\r\n\r\nFix problem when encountering special files type on linux.\r\n\r\nImprove directory monitoring so that the related thread actually waits without using\r\nany CPU time when there are no events.\r\n\r\n## Project Change Improvements\r\n\r\nImprove the suggestion when changing project folder or opening a new one.\r\nNow the previously used directory are suggested but if the path is changed the actual existing directories that match the pattern are suggested.\r\nIn addition always use the text entered in the command view even if a suggested entry is highlighted.\r\n\r\nWith the new implementation it is to switch to a recently used project but you can also navigate the filesystem to easily find any directory.\r\n\r\n## NagView Improvements\r\n\r\nThe NagView warning window now no longer moves the documents' content.\r\nThe message is now completely drawn over the existing content to be less

macOS.\r\n- Fix problem when trying to close an unsaved new document.\r\n- No longer shows an error for the `-psn` argument passed to the application on macOS.\r\n- Fix `treeview:open-in-system`

Activated with the shortcut `ctrl+shift+l`.\r\n- Improve the find and replace dialog so that previously used expressions can be recalled using \"up\" and \"down\" keys.\r\n- Build package script rewrite with many improvements.\r\n\r\n## Style changes\r\n\r\n- Use bigger fonts by default.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks to the contributors: @adamharrison, @takase1121, @Guldoman, @redtide, @Timofffee,

Fix problem with large directories\r\n\r\nWhen opening directories with too many files lite-xl now keep displaying files and directories in the treeview.\r\nThe application remains functional and the directories can be explored without using too much memory.\r\nIn this operating mode the files of the project are not indexed so the command \"Core: Find File\" will act as the \"Core: Open File\" command.\r\nThe \"Project Search: Find\" will work by searching all the files present in the project directory even if they are not indexed.\r\n\r\n### Alternate font based on syntax\r\n\r\nImplemented changing fonts per syntax group by @liquidev.\r\n\r\nExample user module snippet that makes all comments italic:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal style = require \"core.style\"\r\n\r\n-- italic.ttf must be provided by the user\r\nlocal italic = renderer.font.load(\"italic.ttf\", 14)\r\nstyle.syntax_fonts[\"comment\"] = italic\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other improvements and fixes\r\n\r\nImproved indentation and comment/uncomment behavior by @adamharrison.\r\n\r\nFix problem when starting session in maximized mode by @redtide.\r\n\r\nFix bug with close button not working in borderless window mode.\r\n\r\nFix problem with normalization of filename for opened documents.\r\n\r\nImprove detectindent plugin to avoid excessive usage of CPU affecting editing

Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\nFix application crash when using the command `core:restart`.\r\n\r\nImprove application startup to avoid flashing window's problem.\r\n\r\nFix a few problems with documents' filenames.\r\n\r\n### New plugins versioning\r\n\r\nMove to new plugins versioning scheme using tag `mod-version:1`.\r\nThe mod-version is a single digit version that tracks the plugins compatibility version independently from the lite-xl version.\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility the tag `-- lite-xl 1.16` is considered equivalent to `mod-version:1` so users don't need to update their plugins.\r\n\r\nBoth kind of tags can appear in new plugins in the form:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n-- mod-version:1 -- lite-xl 1.16\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the old tag needs to appear at the end for

Plugin verification\r\n\r\nImplement a new system to check the compatibility of plugins by checking a release tag.\r\nPlugins that don't have the release tag will not be loaded.\r\nUsers are invited to update the plugins from the official repository https://github.com/franko/lite-plugins .\r\n\r\n### Improved NagView\r\n\r\nImprove and extend the NagView with keyboard commands and introduce dialog commands.\r\nSpecial thanks to @takase1121 for the implementation and @liquidev for proposing and\r\ndiscussing the enhancements.\r\n\r\n### Support for Mac OS X\r\n\r\nAdd support to build on Mac OS X with specific keyboard bindings.\r\nWe provide in addition a notarize application bundle.\r\nSpecial thanks to @mathewmariani for his lite-macos fork, the Mac OS specific\r\nresources and his support.\r\n\r\n### On text change hook\r\n\r\nAdd hook function `DocView.on_text_change` so that plugin can accurately react on document changes.\r\nThanks to @vincens2005 for the suggestion and testing the implementation.\r\n\r\n### Border-less window\r\n\r\nEnable borderless window mode using the `config.borderless` variable.\r\nIf enable the system window's bar will be replaced by a title bar provided\r\nby lite-xl itself.\r\n\r\n### Fixed a bug in the graphics engine\r\n\r\nFix a drawing engine bug that caused increased CPU usage for drawing operations.\r\n\r\n### Add function to set window opacity\r\n\r\nAdd `system.set_window_opacity` function. Many thanks to @AqilCont for his suggestion.\r\n\r\n### Integrate draw-white-space plugin\r\n\r\nAdd codepoint replacement API to support natively the \"draw whitespaces\" option.\r\nIt supersedes the `drawwhitespace` plugin. If can be configured using the\r\n`config.draw_whitespace` boolean variable and enabled and disables using the\r\ncommands `draw-whitespace:toggle`, `draw-whitespace:enable`,\r\n`draw-whitespace:disable`.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/40109730","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/40109730/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/40109730/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/tag/v1.16.5","id":40109730,"author":{"login":"franko","id":433545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/433545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko","html_url":"https://github.com/franko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTQwMTA5NzMw","tag_name":"v1.16.5","target_commitish":"master","name":"Lite

plugin."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/39331209","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/39331209/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/39331209/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/tag/v1.16.2-lite-xl","id":39331209,"author":{"login":"franko","id":433545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/433545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko","html_url":"https://github.com/franko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM5MzMxMjA5","tag_name":"v1.16.2-lite-xl","target_commitish":"master","name":"Lite

new release introduce some new features like project directories and integrate the workspace plugin while polishing a little bit some rough corners.\r\n\r\n**Project directories**\r\n\r\nExtend your project by adding more directories using the command `core:add-directory`.\r\nTo remove them use the corresponding command `core:remove-directory`.\r\n\r\n**Workspaces**\r\n\r\nThe workspace plugin from rxi/lite-plugins is now part of Lite XL.\r\nIn addition to the functionalities of the original plugin the extended version will\r\nalso remember the window size and position and the additonal project directories.\r\nTo not interfere with the project's files the workspace file is saved in the personal\r\nLite's configuration folder.\r\nOn unix-like systems it will be in: `$HOME/.config/lite-xl/ws`.\r\n\r\n**Scrolling the Tree View**\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to scroll the tree view when there are too many visible items.\r\n\r\n**Recognize `~` for the home directory**\r\n\r\nAs in the unix shell `~` is now used to identify the home directory.\r\n\r\n**Files and Directories**\r\n\r\nAdd command to create a new empty directory within the project using the command\r\n`files:create-directory`.\r\nIn addition a control-click on a project directory will prompt the user to create\r\na new directory inside the directory pointed.\r\n\r\n**New welcome screen**\r\n\r\nShow 'Lite XL' instead of 'lite' and the version number.\r\n\r\n**Various fixes and improvements**\r\n\r\nA few quirks previously with some of the new features have been fixed for a better user experience.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/35350228","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/35350228/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/35350228/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/releases/tag/v1.14.1-lite-xl","id":35350228,"author":{"login":"franko","id":433545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/433545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko","html_url":"https://github.com/franko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franko/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTM1MzUwMjI4","tag_name":"v1.14.1-lite-xl","target_commitish":"master","name":"Lite
